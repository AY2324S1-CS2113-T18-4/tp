## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: There are 2 files used for storage, `./data/nuscents.txt` and `./data/hmac`. Copy both files over to the target
computer.

**Q**: What happens if I modify the storage file ?

**A**: The application is programmed to exit immediately if it detects that the storage file has been tampered with. 
You will either need to revert the storage file back to the last known 'good state', or delete both the 
`./data/nuscents.txt` and `./data/hmac` files and run the program again. Note that deleting the files will cause a loss
of previously stored data.
